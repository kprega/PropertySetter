# PropertySetter
An application facilitating the mass change of model objects properties in Tekla Structures.

## Introduction
When one is working with Tekla Structures, there's a need to follow some principles. Sometimes they're written down into BIM Execution Plan, sometimes not. One way or another, you probably will need to assign proper phases, names, numbering series and other properties of your model objects. Few years ago I learned how to write macros for Tekla Structures, and at that time we used few macros and selection filters to ensure correct properties are applied. I thought, that it is somewhat stupid, that you can read value of given property name, but there's no possibility to change it in that way. Finally, it is possible thanks to this app.

## Usage
All info will be provided soon in Help section. Please be patient.
